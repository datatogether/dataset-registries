> Creating Registries of all these Rescued Datasets

Currently this repository is a space for tracking the design and implementation of the metadata registries we will use to track rescued datasets.

# Roadmap

Short version of the roadmap:

1. First Iteration
  * Establish a simple metadata format that works for a basic implementation
  * Decide where & how the first-pass of these registries will be published
  * Deploy a first-pass version of the registries
  * Provide a way for people to search & browse through the contents of the registries
  * Observe what needs improvement
2. Second Iteration
  * Improve or Replace the solution based on lessons learned.

## Current Status

We are currently in the initial design phase of this work.
